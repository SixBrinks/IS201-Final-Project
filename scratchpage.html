<h3>1. Understanding the Basic Rules of Hockey</h3>
<br>
Hockey is a fast-paced sport played on an ice rink, typically between two teams of six players each. The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team by shooting a small rubber puck into their net using a hockey stick. Players are allowed to skate and pass the puck, and they must follow specific rules, such as staying onside, not icing the puck, and avoiding penalties. The game is divided into three periods, with a short break in between each, and teams switch ends after each period.
<br>
Penalties Include:
<br>
<ol>
    <li>Checking Infractions</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Boarding</li>
            <li>Charging</li>
            <li>Interference</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Stick Infractions</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Tripping</li>
            <li>Slashing</li>
            <li>Hooking</li>
        </ul>
</ol>

<h3>2. Learning Key Skills: Skating, Passing, and Shooting</h3>
<br>
To play hockey effectively, players must master a few key skills. Skating is fundamental, as hockey is played on ice, and players need to move quickly and efficiently in all directions. Passing and shooting are also essential for both offense and defense. When passing, players use their stick to send the puck to a teammate, ideally to set up a scoring opportunity. For shooting, players aim at the opponent's goal, trying to outmaneuver the goalie and score a goal. Proper technique, such as using the correct part of the stick and keeping your head up while handling the puck, is crucial for accuracy and control.

<h3>3. Playing Defense and Special Teams</h3>
<br>
In addition to offensive skills, hockey players must learn how to play defense. Defenders need to block shots, check opponents off the puck, and disrupt the opposing team's plays. Good positioning and anticipation are key, as defenders must read the play and react quickly to prevent scoring opportunities. Special teams, such as the power play (when a team has a player advantage due to a penalty) and penalty kill (when a team is shorthanded), also play a significant role in hockey strategy. During these situations, players must adjust their tactics to either capitalize on an advantage or minimize the impact of a disadvantage, using careful puck movement and strong defensive play.
